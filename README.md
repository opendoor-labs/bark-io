## Requirements
As a take-home problem, you'll be building a marketing page for a fake product called Bark.io. It's an app that matches potential dog-adopters with dogs. This should take around an hour to build. Here are the requirements:
* [ ] The layout of the page is to-spec.
* [ ] The layout is responsive.
* [ ] The header behaves correctly.

## Tips
* You can find the specs in `/specs` and all the images you'll need in `/images`.
* All the fonts and colors you'll need are in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.
* You're encouraged to use any tools you'd like, such Less, Sass, Grunt, etc.

* Simple, understandable CSS
* Concise (fewer HTML elements is better)
* Organized and reusable code
* What tools you like to use
